This is a Python wrapper to libcangjie, the library implementing Cangjie and
Quick input methods.

The libcangjie source code itself is available too:
    https://github.com/wanleung/libcangjie/

Getting the source code
=======================

The Git sources are available at the following address:
    https://github.com/bochecha/pycangjie

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
``autogen.sh`` script first.

The bindings should work with Python 2 or 3. The default is Python 2, and you
can build with Python 3 instead by passing the appropriate option to the
``configure`` script::

    $ configure --enable-python3
