Quick input methods.

The libcangjie source code itself is available too:

Getting the source code
=======================

The Git sources are available at the following address:

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
``autogen.sh`` script first.
