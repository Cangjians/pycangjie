This is a Python wrapper to libcangjie, the library implementing Cangjie and
Quick input methods.

The libcangjie source code itself is available too:
    https://github.com/wanleung/libcangjie/

Getting the source code
=======================

The Git sources are available at the following address:
    https://github.com/bochecha/pycangjie

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
``autogen.sh`` script first.

Note: On some multilib-enabled Linux distributions, the 64 bits libraries are
installed in `/usr/lib64`. If building for such a 64 bits distribution, you
should pass the `--libdir=/usr/lib64` parameter to the `configure` script.

Dependencies
============

To build these bindings, you will need the following:

  - Python >= 3.2
      -> http://python.org

  - Cython >= 0.17
      -> http://cython.org/

  - libcangjie
      -> https://github.com/wanleung/libcangjie

  - a C++ compiler
      We strongly recomment g++
      -> http://gcc.gnu.org/
