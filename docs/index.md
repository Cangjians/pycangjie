pycangjie is a very simple library:

* just import the `cangjie` module
* everything happens by instanciating a `Cangjie` object, and then calling
  its various methods.

These pages will document proper use of pycangjie. Although the interesting
part is the last of the list, we recommend you read them in order:

1. the possible exceptions (see errors.md)
2. the supported Cangjie versions (see versions.md)
3. the available output filters (see filters.md)
4. the `CangjieChar` class (see cangjiechar.md)
6. the `Cangjie` class (see cangjie.md)
